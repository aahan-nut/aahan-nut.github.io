      <h2>5. James Harden (2017-2020)</h2>
      <p>In his prime, nobody could guard James Harden. Literally nobody could stop this man. Whether it was the infamous step back or the rule exploitation, he was insane.</p>

    <div class="player-section">
      <h2>4. Kobe Bryant (2005-2010)</h2>
      <p>The Black Mamba, unstoppable. Took and greened shots over multiple defenders.</p>

    <div class="player-section">
      <h2>3. Michael Jordan (Mid 90s)</h2>
      <p>Regarded as the GOAT, but played in a different era and it's tough to judge how he could adjust in modern times. Still, one heck of a player with crazy athleticism.</p>

    <div class="player-section">
      <h2>2. Kevin Durant (2013-14 and 2017-18)</h2>
      <p>Crazy to think what could've been if injuries didn't riddle his career. The Slim Reaper, standing at 6'11, was a nightmare for defenders as he shot hangpulls at 54 percent.</p>

    <div class="player-section">
      <h2>1. LeBron James (2008-2018)</h2>
      <p>Don't overthink it. Just look at how long that prime was. This is the freaking GOAT, LeBron Raymone James. An unstoppable force that makes opponents hallucinate.</p>
